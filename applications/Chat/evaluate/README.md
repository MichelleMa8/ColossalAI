## Overview

In this directory, we introduce how you can evaluate your model with our pipeline. This pipeline is now available for evaluation of both Chinese and English capability.

## Installation

To start model evaluation, you need to install required packages which listed in `requirements.txt` under `evaluate` folder.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation Pipeline

The whole evaluation pipeline consists of three methods:

1. `GPT Evaluation`: evaluates model predictions using GPT models.
   * Compare the performance of two different models (battle).
   * Rate the model according to pre-defined metrics using prompting design.
   * Rate the model according to pre-defined metrics with additional reference answer using prompting design.
2. `Automatic Evaluation`: evaluates model predictions using automatic metrics.
3. `UniEval`: evaluates model predictions using UniEval models(English only).

### Evaluation Category

Our evaluation pipeline examines the model's capability using 10 categories of questions. The following table introduces each category:

|    Summarization    | **Example 1:**<br/>材料：2020年2月18日，陕西省西安市，复工后的古城西安街头依旧行人寥寥，机动车数量比之前的两周略有增加。乘坐公交车时需要进行实名登记并测量体温，不过公交车上乘客不多，登记起来也不是很耽误时间。北大街街头鲜有市民经过，偶尔路过的也都戴着口罩。许多人外出的原因只是购买生活必需品或者办事，如果没有特别要紧的事情，大家还是少上街比较好。西华门十字路口正在执勤的女交警，虽然交通比平日通畅许多，但仍在兢兢业业工作。疫情尚未完全控制住的日子里，这些人在替我们维持着城市的正常运转。街上的机动车变少后的一个好处是，空气质量大为改观，暖暖的阳光洒下来感觉十分美好。钟鼓楼下沉广场不复往日的喧哗，只有两个安保人员在值守。钟楼地下盘道里，偶尔能看到一个行人经过。整个城市彷佛被按下了“暂停键”，希望热闹的街角能早日回来。<br/>总结概括以上材料，字数不超过80字。<br/><br/> **Example 2:**<br/>材料：央视新闻移动网讯，首届中国国际进口博览会开幕式11月5日上午在上海国家会展中心举行，国家主席习近平出席开幕式并发表主旨演讲。习近平：改革开放40年来，中国人民自力更生、发愤图强、砥砺前行，依靠自己的辛勤和汗水书写了国家和民族发展的壮丽史诗。同时，中国坚持打开国门搞建设，实现了从封闭半封闭到全方位开放的伟大历史转折。开放已经成为当代中国的鲜明标识。中国不断扩大对外开放，不仅发展了自己，也造福了世界。（原题为《【独家V观】习近平：开放已经成为当代中国的鲜明标识》）<br/>总结概括以上材料，字数不超过80字。 | **Example 1:**<br/>Wikipedia article: Angels in art. Angels have appeared in works of art since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for Byzantine and European paintings and sculpture. Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the living creatures (which have beastial characteristics), ophanim (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and cherubim (which have mosaic features); perhaps to these ends, most scriptural angels warn the recipient of their messages to not fear them. As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless. In 19th-century art, especially funerary art, this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.<br/>Summarize the above Wikipedia article in no more than 50 words.<br/><br/>**Example 2:**<br/>Wikipedia article: Annealing. Annealing may refer to: Annealing (metallurgy), a heat treatment that alters the microstructure of a material causing changes in properties such as strength, hardness, and ductility Annealing (glass), heating a piece of glass to remove stress Annealing (biology), in genetics, means for complementary sequences of single-stranded DNA or RNA to pair by hydrogen bonds to form a double-stranded polynucleotide Simulated annealing, a numerical optimization technique for searching for a solution in a space otherwise too large for ordinary search methods to yield results Quantum annealing, a method for finding solutions to combinatorial optimisation problems and ground states of glassy systems using quantum fluctuations.<br/>Summarize the above Wikipedia article in no more than 50 words. |

GPT models evaluate the quality of model predictions based on the given prompt words and gives a score between 1-5.

> **NOTE 1:**  Even for the same metric, the details of its prompt words and CoT(Chain-of-Thought) can differ based on which category you want to evaluate. For example, prompt words for metric `correctness` showed here is "Whether the answer is correct or not."(this is for category `classification`), but for category `extraction`, prompt words can be "Answers should extract the required information accurately and should not contain any incorrect or misleading information." You can find all the prompt words and CoT(Chain-of-Thought) in `prompt/evaluation_prompt`.

> **NOTE 2:** To add customized metrics, you can refer to [FAQ](#faq).

#### Automatic Evaluation

Automated metrics evaluate the capability of a model by comparing model predictions with reference answers.
There are two ways to obtain reference answers:

* For instruction coming from human-designed problems, the reference answers are generated by GPT-3.5, such as roleplay, chat.
* For instruction related with classic NLP problems, the reference answers are collected from open-sourced dataset with target answers, such as classification, extraction, summarization.

There are 6 types of automatic evaluation metrics listed in the table below:

|     Automatic Evaluation Metric     | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|               BLEU-n                | Measure the accuracy between prediction and reference.<br/> BLEU-1 (Unigram) evaluates accuracy in word level.<br/> BLEU-n (n-gram) evaluate the fluency in sentence level. |
|                ROUGE                | ROUGE-N measures the number of matching n-grams between prediction and reference. <br/> ROUGE-L measures the number of matching longest common subsequence (LCS) between prediction and reference. |
|              Distinct               | Measure the diversity of generation text by counting the unique n-grams. |
|              BERTScore              | Measure the semantic similarity between tokens of predictions and references with BERT. |
| Precision<br/> Recall<br/> F1 Score | Measure the number of overlaps between prediction and reference (design for classification and extraction categories). |
|                CHRF                 | Measure the similarity of character n-grams between prediction and reference. |

#### UniEval Evaluation

UniEval converts all evaluation tasks of different dimensions(metrics) into Boolean QA problems and utilize the model to answer with “Yes” or “No”. Compared with similarity-based metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU, UniEval can achieve a more comprehensive evaluation. In addition, UniEval also demonstrates its ability to transfer to unseen dimensions and tasks.

In our evaluation pipeline, two pre-trained UniEval evaluators are used. One is [unieval-sum](https://huggingface.co/MingZhong/unieval-sum) and the other is [unieval-dialog](https://huggingface.co/MingZhong/unieval-dialog). The two models can be used for the 3 tasks, `summarization`, `dialogue` and `data2text`. Each task has different evaluation dimensions.

| UniEval Model  | Task               | Dimension(Metric) |
| :------------: | :----------------- | :--- |
| unieval-sum    | summarization | coherence: whether the summary is coherent<br/>consistency: whether the claim is consistent with the given document<br/>fluency: whether the paragraph is fluent<br/>relevance: whether the summary is relevant to the reference |
| unieval-sum | data2text | naturalness: whether the utterance is fluent<br/>informativeness: whether the utterance is informative according to the reference |
| unieval-dialog | dialogue | naturalness: whether the response is natural in the dialogue<br/>coherence: whether the response is coherent in the dialogue history<br/>understandability: whether the response is understandable in the dialogue |

> **NOTE 1:**  Task "data2text" uses the same model as task "summarization".

> **NOTE 2:**  In UniEval paper, the `unieval-sum` model demonstrates the best transfer ability and so you can evaluate your customized metric with this model. Details of adding customized metrics can be found in [FAQ](#faq).

> **NOTE 3:**  We consider not including all metrics provided in UniEval in our pipeline because the data structure and content of the instructions we want to evaluate are not suitable for direct use of some UniEval metrics.

## Evaluation Process

### Data Format

#### Target Answers / Predictions

A JSON file contains one list. Each element in the list is a target answer / prediction record for one instruction / question.
An element should have the following fields:

* `category` (str, compulsory): The category of the instruction / question.
* `instruction` (str, compulsory): The instruction / question for the LLM.
* `input` (str, optional): The additional context of the instruction / question.
* `output` (str, optional): The sample output of the instruction (default: GPT-3.5).
* `target` (str, optional): The target answer for the instruction.
* `id` (int, compulsory): The ID of the instruction / question.

If the `input` has a target answer, the `output` can be empty. Otherwise, we generate answers from GPT-3.5 as the `output`, and the `target` field is empty.

Example:

```json

        "target": "{target answer}",
        "id": 2
    }
]
```

#### Model Answers / Predictions

A JSON file contains one list. Each element in the list is a model answer / prediction record for one instruction / question.

An element should have the following fields:

* `category` (str, compulsory): The category of the instruction / question.
* `instruction` (str, compulsory): The instruction / question for the LLM.
* `input` (str, optional): The additional context of the instruction / question.
* `output` (str, compulsory): The output from the LLM.
* `target` (str, optional): The target answer for the instruction.
* `id` (int, compulsory): The ID of the instruction / question.

Example:

`"metrics"`: the metrics that can be used in GPT evaluation. This field determines which metrics can be added to your config file.

`"CoT"`: evaluation steps you prompt to GPT models for each metric defined in `"metrics"`.

### Evaluation

#### Configuration

The following is an example of a Chinese config file. The configuration file can control how the pipeline evaluates the model. You need to specify GPT evaluation metrics, automatic metrics and UniEval metrics in key `GPT`, `Metrics` and `UniEval`(English only). You can find an example English config file in `config`.

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "path_for_UniEval": {
        "summarization": "path to unieval-sum model",
        "dialogue": "path to unieval-dialog model",
        "data2text": "path to unieval-sum model"
    },
    "category": {
        "brainstorming": {
            "GPT": ["relevance", "creativity", "practicality", "reasonableness"],
            "Metrics": ["Distinct"],
            "UniEval": ["summarization-fluency", "data2text-naturalness", "data2text-informativeness"]
        },
        "chat": {
            "GPT": [ "relevance", "naturalness", "engagingness", "reasonableness"],
            "Metrics": ["Distinct"],
            "UniEval": ["dialogue-naturalness", "dialogue-coherence", "dialogue-understandability"]
        }
    }
}
```

`"language"`: the language used to evaluate the model capability. We only support Chinese `"cn"` for now.

`"path_for_UniEval"`: path to the UniEval model.

`"category"`: the category/categories needed to evaluate the model capability.

`"GPT"`: the metrics you want to use for GPT evaluation.

`"Metrics"`: the metrics you want to use for automatic metrics evaluation.

`"UniEval"`: the metrics you want to use for UniEval metrics evaluation. The metric has to be in the `"{task}-{metric}"` format because different tasks have same metrics such as naturalness and coherence.

You can remove the key such as `"Metrics"` to skip evaluating answers using its corresponding evaluation metrics.

You can create your config file based on available settings listed in following table.

> **NOTE:**  For categories which don't have standard answers such as `brainstorming`, you should avoid using automatic metrics such as `BLEU` and `ROUGE` which are based on similarity measures and you should use `Distinct` instead in your config file.

#### Evaluate

After setting the configuration file, you can evaluate the model using `eval.py`. If you want to make comparisons between answers of two different models, you should specify two answer files in the argument `answer_file_list` and two model names in the argument `model_name_list`. If you want to evaluate one answer file, the length of both `answer_file_list` and `model_name_list` should be 1 and the program will perform evaluation using automatic metrics and GPT models.

An example script is provided as follows:

```shell
python eval.py \
    --config_file "path to the config file" \
    --battle_prompt_file "path to the prompt file for battle" \
    --gpt_evaluation_prompt_file "path to the prompt file for gpt evaluation" \
    --target_file "path to the target answer file" \
    --answer_file_list "path to the answer files of at most 2 models" \
    --model_name_list "the names of at most 2 models" \
    --gpt_model "which GPT model to use for evaluation" \
    --save_path "path to save results" \
    --openai_key "your openai key" \
```

If you want GPT evaluation with reference, you can add an argument `--gpt_with_reference`.

## FAQ

<details><summary><b>How can I add a new GPT evaluation metric?</b></summary>

For example, if you want to add a new metric `persuasiveness` into category `brainstorming`, you should add the metric definition and its corresponding CoT(Chain-of-thought) in the evaluation prompt file in `prompt/evaluation_promt`. The CoT can be generated using ChatGPT. You can prompt ChatGPT to generate evaluation steps for the new metric.

```json
{
  "brainstorming": {
    "id": 1,
    "category": "brainstorming",
    "metrics": {
      "persuasiveness": "persuasiveness(1-5)：a short description for persuasiveness"
    },
    "CoT": {
      "persuasiveness": "CoT for persuasiveness\n\npersuasiveness："
    },
    "prompt": "You are a good assistant. Please rate the given answer to the \"brainstorming\" question below.\n\nThe question is as follows:\n\n{question}\n\nThe answer is as follows:\n\n{answer}\n\nThe metric for evaluation is as follows:\n\n{metric}\n\nYou should follow the following evaluation steps:\n\n{steps}"
  }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>How can I add a new UniEval evaluation metric?</b></summary>

For example, if you want to add a new metric `persuasiveness` into task `data2text`, you should add a Boolean QA question about the metric in function `add_question` in `unieval/utils.py`. Please do note that how effectively the model would evaluate this metric is unknown and you may need some experiments to test whether the model is capable of evaluating this metric.

```python
if task == 'data2text':
	if dimension == 'persuasiveness':
		cur_input = 'question: Is this a persuasive utterence </s> utterance: ' + output[i]
```
